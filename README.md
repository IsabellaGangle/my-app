Conveying that we need to consider the trends of younger generations and how it is starting to become common in people identifying themselves as nonreligious and making it harder for patients to really resonate with traditional treatments where it is heavily religiously affiliated.

Twelve step programs, while they are available to many people, might not have the best staff available. The staff are generally unaware of the type of things they are dealing with, and cannot help their clients to the best of their abilities.

Treatment offers isolation from drugs and it’s a safe place for you to get the care you need, but treatment centers or part of an industry. In order to survive in the business world they need clients, treatment facilities don’t talk about The 12 Steps, AA, NA, or the “Big Books”. If they don't, more people are likely to relapse, come back to the facility, and fund their business.
