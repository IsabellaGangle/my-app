                        50% of people with co-occurring disorders never get treatment for either of their conditions. Dual Diagnosis is when someone has both a Mental Disorder, and a Substance Use Disorder. Treatment for both conditions should happen simultaneously, which means that treatment is different than just treating a Substace Use Disorder.
